            <h3>Muscle Building</h3>
            <p>Muscle building exercises focus on strength training and resistance workouts to increase muscle mass and strength. Compound movements like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and pull-ups target multiple muscle groups, promoting efficient muscle growth. Progressive overload, proper form, and adequate protein intake play a crucial role in muscle development. Consistency, rest, and recovery are essential for optimal results and preventing injuries.</p>
